// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


Start
	INPUT num1
	INPUT num2
	Sum= num1 + num2
	PRINT sum
Stop





// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Ask for 1 number 
If the number is divisible by 2 and the remainder is 0 print even		
If the number is divisible by 2 and the remainder is 1 print odd
		


Start
	INPUT num
		IF num % 2 results in 0
			PRINT odd
		ELSE num % 2 results in 1 
			PRINT even
Stop




// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are



ask for 5 numbers
add the 5 numbers together and divide them by 5 to get the average
from the numbers entered, find the number with the minimum value, and find the number with the maximum value
print on screen the results of the average 
print on screen which number has the minimum value 
print on screen which number has the maximum value



Start
	read num1
	read num2 
	read num3
	read num4 
	read num5

		num1 + num2 + num3 + num4 + num5 = sum
			sum/5 = average

			IF num > max 
				Max = num
			IF num < min
				Min = num

	Print average
	Print minimum number
	Print maximum number
Stop
